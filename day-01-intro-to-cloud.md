# Day 01 – Cloud Computing: The Big Picture

## Course
Cloud Computing: The Big Picture  
Instructor: David Chappell  
Platform: Pluralsight

## Core Concepts

### What is Cloud Computing?
Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of computing resources
(servers, storage, databases, networking, software) over the internet
with pay-as-you-go pricing.

### Three main concepts discussed in cloud computing
- **Cloud applications** (Software as a Service)

- **Cloud platforms** (Technologies for running applications, storing data and more)

- **Private clouds** (Running cloud platform in on-premises datacenters)

## Cloud Platform Tecnologies
### 1. Compute
- **IaaS** – Infrastructure as a Service  
  Example: AWS Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), Azure Virtual Machines and GCP Compute Engine

- **PaaS** – Platform as a Service  
  Example: AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Azure App Service and GCP App Engine

  - **CaaS** – Container as a Service  
  Example: AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS), Azure Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) and GCP Kubernetes Engine

  - **FaaS** – Function as a Service  
  Example: AWS Lamda, Azure Functions and GCP Cloud Functions

- **SaaS** – Software as a Service  
  Example: Gmail, Office 365

  ### 2. Data

  - **Object Storage**   
  Example: AWS Simple Storage Service (S3), Azure Blobs and GCP Cloud storage

  - **Relational**   
  Example: AWS Relational Database Service (RDS), Azure SQL database and GCP Cloud SQL

    - **NoSQL**   
  Example: AWS DynamoDB, Azure Cosmos DB and GCP Cloud Bigtable

### Deployment Models
- Public Cloud
- Private Cloud
- Hybrid Cloud
- Multi-cloud

## Why Cloud Matters
- Scalability
- Cost efficiency
- Global availability
- Faster innovation

## Reflection 
As a full-stack developer, cloud allows me to:
- Deploy applications globally
- Automate infrastructure with code
- Focus more on product logic than hardware
- Transition into roles like Cloud Engineer, Platform Engineer and DevOps Engineer

## How I Would Host a Web App in the Cloud
- Compute: EC2 or container service
- Storage: S3
- Networking: VPC
- Security: IAM
- Monitoring: CloudWatch

## Key Takeaways
- Cloud is not just hosting — it is an operating model
- DevOps and Cloud are inseparable
- Architecture thinking is more important than tools
