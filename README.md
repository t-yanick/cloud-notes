This repository documents my cloud computing learning journey as I
transition from full-stack development into cloud, DevOps, and platform

The notes combine theory, hands-on labs, architectural diagrams, and
personal reflections, with a focus on AWS and a long-term goal of
working in cloud engineering roles in Canada and remote environments.
